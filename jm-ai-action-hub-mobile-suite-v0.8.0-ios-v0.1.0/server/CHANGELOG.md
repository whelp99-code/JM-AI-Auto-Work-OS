# Changelog

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-31

### Native mobile foundation

- Added administrator-created, five-minute QR pairing sessions with HMAC-only code storage and one-time compare-and-set claiming.
- Added device-scoped HMAC access tokens, short access lifetime, rotating refresh-token families, bounded lost-response retry, reuse detection, and remote device revocation.
- Added mobile capabilities, dashboard, review, plan mutation, approval, execution, activity, and HMAC-signed cursor-based delta-change endpoints.
- Added optimistic `revision` checks for plans and action items with explicit HTTP 409 conflicts.
- Added mobile devices, pairing sessions, refresh tokens, offline captures, APNs notifications, and revision columns through Alembic migration `0004_mobile_foundation`.

### Offline capture and push

- Added per-device batch capture idempotency, content-hash conflict detection, concurrent request protection, and stale processing-lock recovery.
- Added APNs token registration and a transactional push outbox with generic privacy-preserving alerts, HTTP/2 ES256 provider authentication, retry, and stale-lock recovery.
- Added push events for review, AI status, follow-up, deadline, and connector failures without embedding source text in notifications.

### iOS contract and interoperability

- Added stable OpenAPI operation IDs and a checked-in `0.8.0` OpenAPI contract.
- Added production HTTPS enforcement, explicit/configured public pairing URL enforcement, minimum iOS app version negotiation, scope isolation, and mobile capability discovery.
- Added QR SVG/terminal output and mobile device administration commands.
- Added HTTP/Swift end-to-end smoke tooling covering pairing, capture, revisioned edits, approval, execution, activity, and changes.
- Preserved all v0.7.0 plans and items in the verified `0004_mobile_foundation` upgrade path.

### Verification

- 78 Python tests pass with warnings treated as errors.
- Statement coverage is 81.27%, above the enforced 80% threshold.
- Fresh v0.7.0 database migration preserves existing plans and action items.
- The Swift client completed a live FastAPI end-to-end flow against the v0.8.0 server.


## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-29

- Added transactional outbox, exponential retry, row claiming, stale-lock recovery, and a separate control-loop worker.

- Added signed Todoist, GitHub, and Fireflies webhook ingestion with delivery deduplication.
- Added Todoist complete/uncomplete/delete handling.
- Added GitHub Issue close/reopen, Pull Request, Workflow Run, and Check Suite handling.

- Added Todoist/GitHub recovery markers and Google Calendar OAuth refresh-token broker.

### Human–AI execution

- Added human/AI/hybrid/external executor metadata.
- Added GitHub workflow adapters for Codex, Claude, Copilot, Orca, Hermes, and Master Worker routes.
- Added dispatch, workflow, check, PR, human-review, and merge state tracking.
- Kept merge, deployment, external communication, and high-impact actions behind human approval.

### Commitments, planning, meetings, and learning

- Added waiting-for and follow-up lifecycle.
- Added duration, deadline, work mode, energy, preferred worker, dependencies, and completion evidence.
- Added daily capacity/overload decisions and AI-delegation candidates.
- Added Fireflies V2 meeting intake and retry.
- Added approval-only personal rules and weekly ROI metrics.

### Interface and security

- Expanded the PWA with Today decision, AI dispatch, and due follow-up panels.
- Expanded REST and MCP tools.
- Added connector active probes and readiness database checks.
- Added CSP, API no-store policy, external share-target script, HSTS in production, request-body limits, and stricter event correlation.
- Added Docker API/worker split, PostgreSQL overlay, systemd worker, and upgrade/verification scripts.

### Verification

- 53 automated tests pass with warnings treated as errors.
- Statement coverage remains above the enforced 80% threshold.
- Python compile and JavaScript syntax checks pass.
